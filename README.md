Leaf is a simple chrome extension that changes your new tab page to display a 'photo-of-the-day' from the awesome [unsplash library](https://unsplash.com/). Unsplash recently opening up a great API, so I thought having some fun with the API would also make for a fun first chrome extension. 

Check out the [unsplash javascript wrapper](https://github.com/CrewLabs/unsplash-source-js)

When I get a chance I'd like to return to this project and dig into the JSON data so that I can properly credit the photographers for the daily photo and add other functionality.

You can check out Leaf in the [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leaf/kjhooagpmjcecfjnnejglkmfcodaaimg)
